## üöÄ **AI App Development Prompt**

You are tasked with developing a modern, full-stack web application called **FlatMate AI**, a smart housing and roommate-matching platform. The primary purpose of the app is to simplify housing searches by leveraging AI to find, analyze, and schedule viewings for rental listings.

### **App Overview:**
- **Name:** FlatMate AI
- **Target Audience:** International students, young professionals, digital nomads
- **Primary Functionality:**
  - Search for apartments/houses through integrated AI-driven web scraping.
  - Automated chat assistant (using OpenAI API) that interacts with users to find and recommend listings based on their preferences.
  - Automatically sets up viewing appointments with landlords or rental agencies.
  - Offers subscription plans (Free Trial, Monthly, Annual) managed via Stripe payments.

   - Animated welcome text
   - Call-to-action buttons ("Get Started," "Login")
   - High-quality, engaging visuals

2. **Features Section:**
   - Animated feature cards showcasing:
     - Unified search (AI scraping)
     - Instant alerts (real-time notifications)
     - Trusted security (verified listings)
     - Lease analysis (AI-driven contract summaries)

3. **Testimonials Component:**
   - Tabbed testimonials with animated transitions between user stories (students, professionals, travelers)

4. **Pricing Component:**
   - Subscription plans (Free Trial, Monthly, Annual) with Stripe integration
   - Animated pricing cards
   - Payment success/cancelation states

5. **AI Chat Interface:**

## üåê **Backend Specifications (Node.js, Express.js):**
- **MongoDB (Database):**
  - Collections:
    - `users`: Authentication, subscription details
    - `listings`: Scraped rental property data
    - `appointments`: Automated appointments and viewing schedules
    - `subscriptions`: Stripe subscription records and billing status
  - Indexes for efficient querying (user ID, location data, appointments timestamps)

- **OpenAI API Integration:**
  - AI-driven web scraping of real-time rental listings from trusted rental platforms
  - AI-powered conversational assistance and recommendation system
  - Lease agreement summary and analysis

- **Web Scraping Engine:**
  - AI-integrated web scraping API/service to fetch current listings based on user chat requests (location, price, amenities)
  - Automatically filters and sanitizes data before storing in MongoDB

- **Automated Appointment Scheduling:**
  - Uses scraped contact details to automatically set viewing appointments
  - Email and SMS integration (optional but recommended via Twilio or SendGrid)
  - Integration with Google Calendar API (optional for calendar synchronization)

- **Stripe Payment Integration:**
  - Subscription management (Free trial, Monthly, Annual)
  - Webhook integration for subscription lifecycle events
  - Secure checkout sessions creation and error handling

## üìå **AI Features and User Flow:**
- **New Chat Interaction:**
  1. User initiates chat request (e.g., "Find me an apartment near [location] within ‚Ç¨[budget]")
  2. OpenAI-powered assistant processes query, initiates web scraping for real-time data.
  3. Results displayed directly in chat, allowing user interaction ("Schedule viewing", "More details", etc.)
  4. User selects an option; AI automatically coordinates viewing appointment (contact landlord or agency via email/message).

- **Lease Contract Analysis:**
  - Upload lease PDF; AI summarizes and highlights key details.

## üéØ **Prompt Instructions for AI Development:**
Your task is to generate:

1. **Frontend React application** (functional UI/UX):
   - Utilize Tailwind CSS for styling.
   - Framer Motion for UI animations.
   - Implement provided components (Hero, Features, Testimonials, Pricing, Chat Interface).

2. **Backend Node.js (Express) application**:
   - RESTful APIs for authentication, subscription payments, and managing user data.
   - AI-integrated web scraping endpoints using OpenAI API to intelligently fetch real-time listing data.
   - Appointment scheduling automation logic.

3. **Database schema design** in MongoDB to support all data requirements listed above.

4. **Full Stripe integration** including subscriptions, webhooks, secure payment processing.

5. **OpenAI API integration** for conversational AI assistant, automated web scraping prompts, lease document analysis, and natural language communication.

6. **Provide clear instructions** to run, deploy, and scale the full-stack application, including cloud deployment suggestions.
